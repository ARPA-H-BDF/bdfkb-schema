## Credits

This project was made with
[linkml-project-cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter), however much of what the cookie cutter provides is not needed here and thus removed. We opted to \[mostly\] stick with cookiecutter template so this would be familiar to someone already familiar with the LinkML project (and template).
